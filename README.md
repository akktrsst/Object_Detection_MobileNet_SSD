# Object Detection with MobileNet SSD

This repository contains a Python script for real-time object detection using the MobileNet SSD model. It uses OpenCV and TensorFlow for the object detection task and can work with either an image file or a live video stream from your webcam.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)
- TensorFlow (for the MobileNet SSD model)
- A webcam (if you want to use live video)

Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:
